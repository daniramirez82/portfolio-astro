I gained hands-on experience with various UX interfaces and discovered my deficiency in **UX/UI.** To address this, I enrolled in an online certification program offered by **Google**. During this program, I and my team created a simple cafe inventory management application using the Google's Agile methodology, **Design Sprint.** We followed the five stages of this process - __Understanding the problem, Sketching solutions, Deciding on the best approach, Creating a prototype, and Validating our solution__ - and arrived at this Figma prototype.
