    description: "This is a personal project I used to learn Next.js. After learning a little bit of React, I proposed to myself to take advantage of the Next.js features, such as server-side rendering and lazy image loading. It is just a news site that takes the information from the New York Times API"

I recently took a course on Nextjs and decided to develop this website using it, building upon my prior knowledge of React basics. I had several objectives in mind, including working with states, utilizing Redux, integrating an API, and providing a good performance and user experience for the end user.  
<br/>
**Highlights:** Nextjs / Altlassian React Components / Tailwind / New York Times API
<br/><br/>
The Framework: I worked on a simple project with **Next.js** to learn about its project structure and understand the __routing methods__ and various __ways to fetch data from an API__ using the __SSR__ system. I adapted my site to the needs of the user by utilizing these tools. I also try to implemented lazy loading areas with a **custom hook**. The algorithm simply states: if the user scrolls down and wants to view the news, make the API call and render the news. Otherwise, do not. I implemented a **custom hook** for lazy loading areas that would only make API calls and render the news when the user scrolls down and requests it. Additionally, I experimented with pre-built React components from the **Atlassian Library** and utilized **Tailwind** for the overall layout. The free news API I selected was **The New York Times API.**
<br/><br/>

**Future plans:** include adding a swipe left/right feature to change the news category and incorporating micro-animations using Framer Motion.
