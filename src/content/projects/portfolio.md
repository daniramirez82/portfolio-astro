I chose to use a ready-made design template to speed up my development process and because I was fond of the design created by a fellow Venezuelan. The design system in Figma made it easy to implement in code and I strived to achieve pixel-perfect results.

Highlights: Astro, Preact, Tailwind, and Markdown.<br/><br/>
I chose **Astro** for its performance and popularity. It was ideal for my portfolio design as it had very few interactive components. Astro has a fast learning curve and showed great performance. I also used **Preact**, which is lighter than its parent library, React, and worked well for my needs. As I had prior experience with **Tailwind**, using its classes during the development process was enjoyable. However, I discovered some new features, such as the ability to group classes to work together in the hover state, which was new to me. **Markdown** syntax was a new experience for me but I found it interesting and suitable for projects like my portfolio. Overall, I believe it worked well for this project.
<br/><br/>
**Next Features:** I would like to implement a **dark mode** and add **Spanish language support**, as a new area to show less important projects or code snippets that I have gained from my learning process.
