From 2019 to 2021, I worked at a bakery store, primarily in the workshop where I was responsible for making the bread. Within a year, we experienced growth and expanded to 4 new stores. As a result, I was responsible for planning production and managing the distribution of bread to the stores. Additionally, I would receive requests from the stores. My app, which started out only receiving requests from the stores, later evolved to include important functions that helped me plan bread production. This included calculating ingredients according to each recipe and keeping track of historical production information.

## **Higthlight:** Svelte / Firebase / MaterialCss / PWA 
<br/>

**Svelte** was my first framework, so it was my obvious choice for developing this app. I found it very easy to manage state with it.

I had my first experience working with non-SQL services, using and learning **Firebase/Firestore** as my backend server.

For the CSS framework, I used the **materialcss** library, and also incorporated some helper libraries such as lodash.

This app is also a **Progressive Web App**, allowing it to be installed like a native app and providing a similar experience. Its give a lot of work with the service worker implementation.

It was my first time going through the entire development process.

This app was my first development project, which explains why the code may not be as clean and lacks a good UX. Despite these shortcomings, it is the only app I have developed that has practical usage. It was extremely helpful in my work. **While it has many areas for improvement**, it is currently functional and adheres to the developers' mantra of 'if it's working, don't touch it.'

**Next Features:** If I have the opportunity, I would like to work on enhancing the **UX/UI and making it responsive**.
