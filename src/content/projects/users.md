This project originated from a Twitch livestream by Midudev where he was solving a test for a job application that required knowledge of React, hooks, and APIs. After successfully completing the test, I decided to add a touch of pre-designed UX/UI using Figma and incorporated some additional tricks.

## **Higthlight:** Reactjs / Figma / Tailwind / UX/UI 
<br/>

This project started with the execution of a live test conducted by Midudev on Twitch. The focus was on solving the given tasks using essential and intermediate React tools such as important hooks like useCallback, useRef, useMemo, as well as custom hooks. To enhance the project further, I decided to work on a UX/UI design from scratch, creating a small Design System and an HD user interface in Figma, which I later developed alongside this project. This brought about challenges in managing state and the overall rendering of the application. To address these challenges, I found solutions by leveraging tools like Redux Toolkit and importing all icons through SVG symbols. Additionally, I encountered some hurdles while using TypeScript.

Future enhancements for the project include implementing a light/dark theme switch.
