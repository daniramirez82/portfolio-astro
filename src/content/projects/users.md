This project showcases my practical implementation of various Reactjs features, demonstrating my proficiency in utilizing hooks such as useMemo, useRef, and useCallback. It also highlights my ability to seamlessly connect with APIs and effectively implement a debounced input. By developing this small-scale project, I gained hands-on experience in applying Reactjs concepts and honed my skills in creating efficient and interactive web applications.

## **Higthlight:** Reactjs / Figma / Tailwind / UX/UI

Initially, my idea was to practice movie search using a debounced API. Along the way, I encountered rendering challenges, which led me to utilize the useMemo and useCallback hooks to achieve efficient results and prevent unnecessary component re-renders during movie searches. Inspired by a beautiful design on Dribbble, I implemented an expandable left menu controlled by a global state using React Context. I incorporated animations and added mock user data to enhance the overall design. The search input includes error handling and is managed by a custom hook.

The entire design system was initially planned using Figma.

Future enhancements for the project include implementing infinite scrolling and login access.
