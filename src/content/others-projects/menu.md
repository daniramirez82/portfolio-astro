In this project, I aimed to explore different tools and techniques for animations in React. Using the Framer Motion library was a great way to add more advanced animations to my React components, and integrating my design work in Figma helped me to achieve a more cohesive look and feel. Taking advantage of SVG and the <symbol> tag to better organize my icons helped reduce duplication and make my code more efficient.

Using my own color variables with SASS was a helpful way to keep my code organized and easy to maintain. I focused on mobile-first design since the template is not responsive.
